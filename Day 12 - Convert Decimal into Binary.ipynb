    "## Solution\n",
    "We will use a Python List as a stack and then we will use **Division By 2** method to solve this problem.<br>\n",
    "Here's the approach:-<br>\n",
    "To convert integer to binary, start with the integer in question and divide it by 2 keeping notice of the quotient and the remainder.<br>Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until you get a quotient of zero. Then just write out the remainders in the reverse order.<br>\n",
    "### Algorithm:<br>\n",
    "Store the remainder when the number is divided by 2 in an array.<br>\n",
    "Divide the number by 2<br>\n",
    "Repeat the above two steps until the number is greater than zero.<br>\n",
    "Print the array in reverse order now.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example:<br>\n",
    "If the binary number is 10.<br>\n",
    "Step 1: Remainder when 10 is divided by 2 is zero. Therefore, arr[0] = 0.<br>\n",
    "Step 2: Divide 10 by 2. New number is 10/2 = 5.<br>\n",
    "Step 3: Remainder when 5 is divided by 2 is 1. Therefore, arr[1] = 1.<br>\n",
    "Step 4: Divide 5 by 2. New number is 5/2 = 2.<br>\n",
    "Step 5: Remainder when 2 is divided by 2 is zero. Therefore, arr[2] = 0.<br>\n",
    "Step 6: Divide 2 by 2. New number is 2/2 = 1.<br>\n",
    "Step 7: Remainder when 1 is divided by 2 is 1. Therefore, arr[3] = 1.<br>\n",
    "Step 8: Divide 1 by 2. New number is 1/2 = 0.<br>\n",
    "Step 9: Since number becomes = 0. Print the array in reverse order. Therefore the equivalent binary number is 1010.<br>"
