# 21-Days-Of-Code-With-Code-Warriors
Recently I came across the initiative started by Code Warriors i.e. 21 Days of Code with Code Warriors.<br/> They started this initiative so that the participants can code continuously for 21 days and build a habit of coding among themselves.<br/> 
My main aim for enrolling in this program was that I can prepare for the companies interview that's going to take place in my college this year.<br/>
So I started with Data Structures and I noticed that I had to cover the following topics during my practice.<br/>
*Array
*Linked List
*Stack
*Queue
*Binary Tree
*Binary Search Tree
*Hashing
*Graph
