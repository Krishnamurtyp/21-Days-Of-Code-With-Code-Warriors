# 21-Days-Of-Code-With-Code-Warriors
Recently I came across the initiative started by Code Warriors i.e. 21 Days of Code with Code Warriors.<br/> They started this initiative so that the participants can code continuously for 21 days and build a habit of coding among themselves.<br/> 
My main aim for enrolling in this program was that I can prepare for the companies interview that's going to take place in my college this year.<br/>
So I started with Data Structures and I noticed that I had to cover the following topics during my practice.<br/>
* Array
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* Hashing
* Graph
# Day 1
```
Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word).
For example:
"public relations" is an anagram of "crap built on lies."
"Clint Eastwood" is an anagram of "old west action"
Note: Ignore spaces and capitalization. So "d go" is an anagram of "God" and "dog" and "o d g".
```

# Day 2
```
Array Sum
Given an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as x
Write a program that, given an array A[] of n numbers and another number x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.

Input: arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
sum = -2
Output: -3, 1
If we calculate the sum of the output,
1 + (-3) = -2


Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 1, 0, 5}
sum = 0
Output: -1
No valid pair exists.
```

# Day 3
```
Find the Missing Element
Problem
Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.

Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.

Input:
finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6]) 
Output:
5 is the missing number
```
