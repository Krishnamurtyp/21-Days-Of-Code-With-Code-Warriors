# 21-Days-Of-Code-With-Code-Warriors
Recently I came across the initiative started by Code Warriors i.e. 21 Days of Code with Code Warriors. They started this initiative so that the participants can code continuously for 21 days and build a habit of coding among themselves. So I also enrolled for the same and decided to write a blog every day that I had learned.
My main aim for enrolling in this program was that I can prepare for the companies interview that's going to take place in my college this year.
So I started with Data Structures and I noticed that I had to cover the following topics during my practice.
Array
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
Hashing
Graph
