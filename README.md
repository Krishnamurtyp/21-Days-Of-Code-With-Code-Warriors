# 21-Days-Of-Code-With-Code-Warriors
Recently I came across the initiative started by Code Warriors i.e. 21 Days of Code with Code Warriors.<br/> They started this initiative so that the participants can code continuously for 21 days and build a habit of coding among themselves.<br/> 
My main aim for enrolling in this program was that I can prepare for the companies interview that's going to take place in my college this year.<br/>
So I started with Data Structures and I noticed that I had to cover the following topics during my practice.<br/>
* Array
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* Hashing
* Graph
# Day 1
```
Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word).
For example:
"public relations" is an anagram of "crap built on lies."
"Clint Eastwood" is an anagram of "old west action"
Note: Ignore spaces and capitalization. So "d go" is an anagram of "God" and "dog" and "o d g".
